<!-- # Generating Random Environments for Beauty Shots (GREBS) -->

<!-- # Intro -->
Today I'm going to talk about Generating Random Environments for Beauty Shots.

A workflow for scene creation, composition, lighting and rendering inside of Blender, utilizing geometry nodes and other tools for rapid ideation.

What are Geometry Nodes?

# Geometry Nodes


In Blender, Geometry Nodes is a "system for modifying the geometry of an object with node-based operations."

It's a powerful toolset within Blender that has lots of uses.

One of those uses is creating generative art.

# Generative art

What is generative art?

Generative art (or Generative design) is artwork that is created with the use of an autonomous system, in our case with algorithms or computer code.

Even though our focus is on computer graphics, artists have been experimenting with generative methods for centuries as a way to introduce randomness into their artwork to stimulate creativity.

Mozart reportedly played
Moo-zi-colleches Were-fish-speel
or "musical dice game", where the order of musical phrases in a composition is determined by rolling dice.

And these are just a couple of early examples of generative art created using computers.

I really started getting more interested in generative art after seeing what some incredible artists were doing using the Geometry Nodes system inside of Blender.

Especially Midge Sinnaeve

These are some examples of scenes he created using Geometry Nodes.

# How can we use this?

What I'm proposing is using these methods to create 3D environments that can be used for product beauty shots, anytime a project calls for renders.

We can create a similar aesthetic to photography, in terms of placing product on risers or other objects.

We can also create setups that would be impractical, or time consuming, to create in the real world.

And in some cases, practically impossible: Like 2 rings floating in front of a wall of crystals.

# Previsualization

It's worth pointing out this isn't about rendering VERSUS photography.

This could simply be a tool used BY photographers for previs.

Previsualization, or previs, allows for experimentation with different staging, lighting, and camera positions, without the need for physical products or other objects.

Here are 2 examples of early previs shots and the final shots.

These shots are probably on the opposite ends of the spectrum of complexity, but previs was utilized for both.

# Examples / Gallery

These are some examples of scenes I created in Blender using various Geometry Node setups.

Creating these setups can be complicated up front, but once they're finished, they can be added to our toolbox for creating multiple shots.

The shots with the same color background were created using the same Geometry Node setups, just changing some settings and camera position.

Each of these shots was created relatively quickly, once the tools were in place.

And these Geometry Nodes aren't just for static images.

We can also animate them, for use in video or social media content.

# Demo Time (Scene_Creation_Workflow)

This last section is a walkthrough of the overall process I used to create the previous examples.

For the sake of time, I'm going to open a Blender file that already has things imported and set up, but pretty much everything I'm doing is documented here.
