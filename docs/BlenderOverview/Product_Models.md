# **Product Models / CAD**

- When starting with the **Master** .blend file, or with a blank scene, any product models that will be rendered must be imported.
- Typically, models will be imported from another .blend file, such as CAD models that have been imported into Blender and prepped for rendering.


---

## **Importing Models from Other .blend Files**

1. Select ***Scene Collection*** in Outliner
1. File > Append… (or Link…)
1. Double-click .blend file with model
1. Click **Collection** > **Parent** Collection of Model
1. Move into position as needed

## **Linking vs. Appending**

### When Linking a Collection / Object using ***File > Link…***
- Imported Collection CAN be translated in the scene
- Imported Objects CANNOT be translated in the scene
- Materials CANNOT be edited for Collections or Objects

### When Appending a Collection / Object using ***File > Append…***
- Imported Objects CAN be translated in the scene
- Materials CAN be edited for Objects
