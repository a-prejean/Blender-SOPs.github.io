{==

Most of the materials needed for our purposes should already exist in the **Master** .blend file; another good reason to set it as your default Startup File.

- With an object is selected, open the Material Properties (green box) to see the Material Slots and any assigned Materials (blue box).
- An object must have at least 1 Material Slot in order to have a material assigned to it.
    - Material Slots can be added or removed with the ++plus++ or ++minus++ buttons (pink box)
